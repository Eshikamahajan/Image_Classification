Using deep neural networks to classify images

# Convolutional Neural Networks
In neural networks, Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classifications.

The below figure is a complete flow of CNN to process an input image and classifies the objects based on values.

In this module, a sequential CNN model is created using Keras. The model is fed the training images of Cats and Dogs and then tested on the test dataset present in a seperate folder.
